Calculate Ts/Tv ratio using MEGA-CC 
:::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::::

Input:
Nucletide sequences of aligned genes in fasta format. Suppose the input files are ../aligned_genes/*.rmgap 

Output:
"TsTv_ratio.txt" which includes the Ts/Tv ratio for each gene family.


Steps:
1) In Linux, run the following script to generate MEGA-CC inputs:
   $ ./step1.prepare_files_for_MEGA-CC.sh
   All required files for running MEGA-CC in Windows are under "calc_TsTv_in_Windows".

2) Copy the whole folder of "calc_TsTv_in_Windows" to Windows, open "Command Prompt"and cd to "calc_TsTv_in_Windows". For example, 
   $ cd C:\Users\Jessie\Desktop\calc_TsTv_in_Windows
   Then run MEGA-CC with the command below in Command Prompt:
   $ M51CC.exe -a ts2tv.mao -d filelist.txt
   The ouput file are under calc_TsTv_in_Windows\aligned_genes_fasta\M5CC_Out. We only need M5CC_Out\*.meg, so move them to a folder called "mega_out" 
   and move "mega_out" folder to Linux "calc_TsTv_in_Windows" directory.

3) Parse MEGA-CC output to "Ts2Tv.res".
   $ ./step3.parse_meg_out.py


Note about *.mao file:
"ts2tv.mao" is MEGA-CC's the configuration file for the calculation of Ts/Tv ratio. It was generated by "M51Proto.exe" in Windows. Don't modify 
it manually. In windows, double click "M51Proto.exe" and a dialogue will be opened. 
1) Under "Specify a data type for analysis", select "Nucleotide (coding)" 
2) Click "Compute Pairwise Distances" under "Distance" menu. In the popup dialogue, make sure "Substitutioins to Include" is set to "R = s/v"
3) Click "Save Settings" on the lower right of the popup dialogue and save is as "ts2tv.mao".
